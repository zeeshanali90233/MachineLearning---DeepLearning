# What is Machine Learning (ML)?
Machine Learning (ML) is a field of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. ML algorithms improve their performance automatically as they are exposed to more data over time.

# What is Deep Learning (DL)?
Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to model complex patterns in large datasets. DL is especially powerful for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
